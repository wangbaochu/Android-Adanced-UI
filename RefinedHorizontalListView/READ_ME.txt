1. Android original UI framework doesnâ€™t implement the HorizontalListView. It only provide the HorizontalScrollView.

2. This RefinedHorizontalListView comes from the open source project, but with some improvement. It scrolls much more smoothly. 

3. If you need more complicated effect, suggest to use RecyclerView which is included in support-v7 library. You can use RecyclerView to customize the ListView as whatever you want. Take reference to this blog: http://blog.csdn.net/wangbaochu/article/details/49434657
