This RefinedListView has improved the Android original ListView. It makes the scrolling much more smoothly. 

Q: How can we do that ?

A: The key point is that donâ€™t load any item (especial the icon) when user is scrolling. Only when the scrolling is stopped, then start to load the item who is visible on screen.
